# Udacity Robotics Nano Degree Program
  
In this Nano degree program, I learned 5 major skills in robotics.  
1. Building robot and architecture models in Gazebo  
2. Understand ROS and design a controller in C++ to control the robot to chasea a ball in Gazebo.  
3. Understand localization algorithm, sensor fusion and coded them in C++ including EKF and MCL (Monte Carlo Locatization)  
4. Understand mapping algorithm and SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping)  
5. Understand navigation and path planning algorithm.  

The Nano Degree includes 5 projects as following:  
Project 1: Build My World (6/30)  
Project 2: Go Chase It (7/21)  
Project 3: Where Am I (8/12)  
Project 4: Map My World (9/3)  
Project 5: Home Service Robot (9/24)
